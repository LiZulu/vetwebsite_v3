Taking your pet to the veterinarian once a year is the same as if you were to see a doctor for an exam only once every 6 to 8 years. As they get older, more frequent examinations may be necessary.',

Internal parasites (hookworms, heartworms, and roundworms) and external parasites (ticks and fleas) are common in pets. Some of these parasites can go from your pet to you or your family (zoonotic). To stop parasites from harming your pets and family, prevention is necessary. We recommend routine exams and laboratory testing to screen for parasites. We carry many of the leading medications and preventative medicines, on-hand and available at our practice. We will help you determine which product will work best for your pet.',

Microchips are implanted into your pet’s skin during a process similar to vaccination. Each microchip is encoded with information about your pet that is tracked in a national database. Veterinary hospitals, clinics, and shelters across the country have special scanners that can detect and read the microchips. If your pet goes missing, their microchip is scanned and the information is used to return your pet home safely.',
